The weresquirrel
Every now and then, usually between 8 p.m and 10 p.m., Jacques finds himself transforming
into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail.
	On one hand, Jacques is quite glad that he doesn't have classic lycanthropy.
Turning into a squirrel does cause fewer problems than turning into a wolf.
Instead of having to worry about accidentally eating the neighbor (that would
be awkward), he worries about being eaten by the neighbor's cat. After two
occasions where he woke up on a precariously thin branch in the crown of an
oak, naked and disoriented, he has taken to lockin the doors and windows of
his room at night and putting a few walnuts on the floor to keep himself busy.
	That takes care of the cat and tree problens. But Jacques would prefer to get rid of his condition entirely. The irregular occurrences of the transformation
make him suspect that they might be triggered by something. For a while, he believed that it happened only on days when he had been near oak trees. But
avoiding oak trees did not stop the problem.
	Switching to a more scientific approach, Jacquees has started keeping a daily 
log of everything he does on a given day and whether he changed form. With 
this data he hopes to narrow down the conditions that trigger the transformation.
